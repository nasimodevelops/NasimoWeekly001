                    for everyone of you recieving this message. Recieving this message entales
                    that you are a part of my tight-knit network of supporters.
                    As an artist, my dream is to resiprocate this space of positivity and 
                    support right back to you. Because at the end of the day family is all 
                    we really have. And when New Folder With Items dropped, I quickly realized
                    that you guys are my family, you guys are #TheNetwork.

                                    I sang my heart out and released the song on soundcloud. I sent the song to everybody in my contacts and
                                    some how it has the most streams out of all my songs.</p>
